# Machine Learning

Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

## Some Applications of Machine Learning

+ Image Recognition
+ Malware detection
+ Voice Recognition

## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

Traditional Programming |  machine Learning  |
-------  |  ------- |
We have Full Understanding of the domain    | We have Vague Understanding of the domain
solution rules are static | Solution rule are dynamic
Does not require historical data | Does require historical data
Straight forward and obvious  | Vague and tricky to understand


## Machine learning Algorithms Types

+ Supervised Learning
+ Unsupervised Learning
+ Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning Types

+ Regression
+ Classification

### Unsupervised Learning Types

+ Clustering
+ Association


### Learning Types in a Nutshell

------- | Supervised  | Unsupervised | Reinforcement  | 
Objective  | Predict future values or categories  | Organize data based on underlying structure  | Adapt based on the rewards and data from the surrounding environment | 
Learning Source | Output dataset | input data patterns | Environment state and rewards |
