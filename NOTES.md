# Machine Learning

Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead.

## Some Applications of Machine Learning

+ Image Recognition
+ Malware detection
+ Voice Recognition

## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

Traditional Programming |  machine Learning  |
-------  |  ------- |
We have Full Understanding of the domain    | We have Vague Understanding of the domain
solution rules are static | Solution rule are dynamic
Does not require historical data | Does require historical data
Straight forward and obvious  | Vague and tricky to understand


## Machine learning Algorithms Types

+ Supervised Learning
+ Unsupervised Learning
+ Reinforcement Learning

### Supervised Learning Types

+ Regression
+ Classification

### Unsupervised Learning Types

+ Clustering
+ Association


### Learning Types in a Nutshell

------- | Supervised  | Unsupervised | Reinforcement  | 
Objective  | Predict future values or categories  | Organize data based on underlying structure  | Adapt based on the rewards and data from the surrounding environment | 
Learning Source | Output dataset | input data patterns | Environment state and rewards | 


## Learning Modes

+ Batch Learning
+ Online Learning

## Machine Learning Pipeline


### Problem Definition

Five question ML can answer

+ Is this A or B ? Will this customer by or not ?
+ Is this wired 
+ How much - or how many ? How many items well i see in upcoming quoter? 
+ How is this organized ? What are the different customer categories do I have ?
+ What should i do next?

### Data sourcing

+ Several data sources may exist
  + RESTful Endpoints
  + File integration
  + SOAP Endpoints
  + SQL Table
  + Sensors with proprietary format

### Data preparing

+ Several data preparation actions
  + Dealing with missing data
  + Dropping unnecessary attributes
  + Detecting outliers
  + Etc.

### data Segregation

Data is segregated to

+ Training set
+ Validation set

### Model Training

Machine Learning algorithms adjusts
usually on-shelf recipe
May need trying several algorithms

### Model evaluation

Examining model performance using validation data
Different performance measures based on the algorithm type+

### Model deployment

Making model useful for business
Deployed Machine Learning model can take several formats

### model monitoring



+ mean
+ median
+ percentiles

Standard Deviation(标准差)

+ Consider all items
+ Considers data distribution
+ Harder to calculate


## Bivariate Measures(双变量测量)

## Correlation(相关性)

+  Positive Correlation
+  Negative  Correlation
+  No  Correlation

## Correlation Policy

Correlation Fallacy(相关性谬误)

Correlation does not imply casuation
("With this, therefore because of this" fallacy)
